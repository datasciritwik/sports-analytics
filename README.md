# üìÑ Task Document: Combining YOLOv11 Pose and FastVLM-0.5B for Sports Analysis(Only Cricket)

## 1. Introduction

* Purpose of the document: explain how to integrate **pose detection** (YOLOv11-Pose) with **vision-language reasoning** (FastVLM-0.5B).
* Importance: Real-time sports analysis, coaching feedback, and performance insights.

---

## 2. Overview of the Models

### 2.1 YOLOv11-Pose

* Function: Detects **keypoints** (joints) for each player.
* Output: Coordinates + confidence scores for skeleton tracking.

### 2.2 FastVLM-0.5B

* Function: Lightweight **vision-language model** by Apple.
* Strength: Can interpret images and structured data into **natural language insights**.
* Advantage: Optimized for **on-device use** with very low latency.

## 3. Integration Workflow

### Step 1: Pose Detection with YOLOv11-Pose

* Run YOLOv11-Pose on video frames.
* Extract **17 keypoints** per person (head, shoulders, elbows, knees, ankles, etc.).

### Step 2: Pose Feature Engineering

* Calculate **joint angles** (e.g., elbow bend, knee flexion).
* Measure **distances** (stride length, jump height).
* Track **motion sequences** across frames.

### Step 3: Input to FastVLM-0.5B

* Feed both:

  1. The **frame image**.
  2. A **structured text summary** of pose data.

Example Prompt:

```
<image>
Pose data: Elbow angle = 145¬∞, Knee angle = 95¬∞, Torso tilt = 20¬∞ forward.
Explain if this is the correct tennis serve posture and give improvement tips.
```

### Step 4: FastVLM Reasoning

* Generates **coaching feedback**:

  * ‚ÄúThe elbow is too straight‚Äîbend more for better power.‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúThe knee bend is strong, helping with upward momentum.‚Äù

---

## 4. Use Cases in Sports

* **Technique Correction**: Tennis serve, basketball shot, football kick.
* **Injury Prevention**: Detect unsafe joint positions.
* **Performance Tracking**: Compare motion before vs. after training.

---

## 5. Example Implementation (Python)

* Pose extraction code snippet with YOLOv11-Pose.
* Passing structured pose summary + image to FastVLM.
* Generating natural language insights.

---

## 6. Benefits of the Combined Approach

* **Speed**: Real-time analysis with YOLOv11 and FastVLM-0.5B.
* **Accuracy**: Keypoints + reasoning ‚Üí deeper insights.
* **Accessibility**: On-device deployment (Mac/iPad/iPhone).

---

## 7. Next Steps

* Prepare a **demo script** showing YOLOv11-Pose + FastVLM integration.
* Write sample prompts for **different sports scenarios**.
* Create a **short report** with screenshots of outputs (pose overlay + AI feedback).
